    <h2>1945</h2>
    <p> Vannevar Bush writes  in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/world/">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche</p>
    <h3>1960s</h3>
    <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href="http://www.bootstrap.org/library.htm">Bootstrap Institute library</a>.<br><br>
Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate. 20th National Conference, New York, <a href="https://www.acm.org/">Association for Computing Machinery</a>, 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.<br><br>
 Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.</p>
<h4>1980</h4>
<p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See:<a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/scaled/"> Enquire user manual as scanned i </a>or as<a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/manual/"> HTML page(alt)</a>.</p>

<a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">"Information Management: A Proposal</a>" written by <a href="https://www.w3.org/People.html#BernersLee">Tim BL</a> and circulated for comments at <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a> (TBL). Paper "HyperText and CERN" produced as background (<a href="text ">text </a>or <a href="">WriteNow </a>format).</P>

    <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html"> Same proposal</a> recirculated<br></dd>
    September<br>
    Mike Sendall, Tim's boss, Oks the purchase of a NeXT cube, and allows Tim to go ahead and write a global hypertext system.<br>
    October<br>
    Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep development environment. He makes up "WorldWideWeb" as a name for the program. (See  <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb.ht">browser</a> screenshot) "World Wide Web" as a name for the project (over Information Mesh, Mine of Information, and Information Mine).<br>
    Project <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">original proposal</a> reformulated with encouragement from CN and ECP divisional management. Robert <a href="https://www.w3.org/People.html#Cailliau">Cailliau</a> (ECP) joins and is co-author of <a href="https://www.w3.org/Proposal.html">new version</a>.<br>
    November<br>
    Initial <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb">WorldWideWeb program</a> development continues on the NeXT (TBL) . This was a "what you see is what you get" (wysiwyg) browser/editor with direct inline creation of links. The first web server was nxoc01.cern.ch, later called info.cern.ch, and the first web page http://nxoc01.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html Unfortunately CERN no longer supports the historical site. Note from this era too, the least recently modified web page we know of, last changed Tue, 13 Nov 1990 15:17:00 GMT (though the URI changed.)
    November<br>
    Technical Student Nicola Pellow (CN) joins and starts work on the line-mode browser. Bernd Pollermann (CN) helps get interface to CERNVM "FIND" index running. TBL gives a colloquium on hypertext in general.
    Christmas<br>
    Line mode browser and WorldWideWeb browser/editor demonstrable. Acces is possible to hypertext files, CERNVM "FIND", and Internet news articles.

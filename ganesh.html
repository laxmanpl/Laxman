     <h3>1960s</h3>
     <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. 
        He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the Bootstrap Institute library.<br><br>

        Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in <i>A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate.</i> 20th National Conference, New York, Association for Computing Machinery, 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.<br><br>
        
        Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.</p>
